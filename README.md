# Project-3-Enterprise-Multi-Tier-Web-App-Deployment
This project demonstrates the deployment of an enterprise-grade Multi-Tier Web Application on AWS. Unlike simple single-server deployments, this architecture separates the application logic (Web Tier) from the data storage (Database Tier) to ensure scalability, security, and high availability.
